			<h3><span>A</span>BOUT ME</h3>
			<img src="./images/profile-pic.jpg" width="25%" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;">
			<p style="display: inline;">Hello! My name is Evalyn Berleant. I am a recent graduate from Brandeis University with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. I have experience in Java, JavaScript, React.js, Vue.js, Python, SQL, and bash. In Summer 2020, I interned at Galatea Associates, where I used the Java Spring Boot framework, React.js, and Lombok to write several API endpoints for various applications. In Fall 2020, I was a member of a robotics-centered independent study, where I developed a live-updating web interface using Vue.js and Python. I have also worked as a TA for Advanced Programming Techniques and Operating Systems, and I interned for CQ Consulting as a contractor for the Arkansas Department of Health in Summers 2018 and 2019. I'm always excited to learn something new!</p>

			<h3><span>P</span>ROGRAMMING</h3>

			<h4><span>React/JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, & d3:</span> <a href="https://youtaite-network.netlify.app">Youtaite Network (in progress)</a></h4>
			<p>This is a fun side project focused on a community of Youtube content creators who often collaborate with each other. I wanted to show how different collaborations are connected to each other through people - for example, if I am in two different collabs, those two collabs are connected through me. I hope to show the existence of different corners within the community, where groups of people collaborate with each other more often than with someone outside of their corner. I have a lot of other ideas for creatively displaying the data (once I have enough of it), such as organizing by the "strength" of a connection, restricting time ranges, and identifying closely-related clusters and "representative" collaborations of those clusters. The <a href="https://youtaite-network.netlify.app">frontend website</a> is written in React. The data visualization is created using d3. The backend API is written in Ruby on Rails. If you feel like checking out the backend API, here are some routes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://youtaite-network-api.herokuapp.com/collabs">https://youtaite-network-api.herokuapp.com/collabs</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://youtaite-network-api.herokuapp.com/people">https://youtaite-network-api.herokuapp.com/people</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://youtaite-network-api.herokuapp.com/roles">https://youtaite-network-api.herokuapp.com/roles</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h4><span>Vue.js/JavaScript & Python:</span> Live-updating Web Interface</h4>
			<p>I worked with Roshan Nanu, Ben Ballintyn, and Chris Tam in a robotics-centered independent study. The project involved building and customizing a Stanford Pupper robot. As part of this, I developed a web interface that displays data in real-time about the robotâ€™s state, including sensor data, computer vision data, and current behavior. I used Vue.js, combined with paper.js, JointJS, and BootstrapVue, for the frontend of the web interface. When the robot is running, its control script (written in Python) pushes data to the web interface, which then updates its display.

			The website can be found at <a href="https://cerbaris.netlify.app/">cerbaris.netlify.app</a>, but without the robot running, no data is being received or updated. A detailed technical description of the site can also be found on the <a href="https://campusrover.github.io/PupperPy/web_interface.html">web interface section of our final project report</a>.</p>

			<h4><span>Java & React</span></h4>
			<p>As an intern at Galatea Associates, I wrote several endpints using Java Spring Boot and Lombok. Through the internship, I learned about dependency injection, annotations and annotation-based configuration, and custom serialization and deserialization through Jackson. One of projects that I worked on at Galatea was developing and improving a website for retrieving and displaying data from their message databases, using React for the frontend and Java Spring Boot for the backend API. I also developed a Java Spring Boot API for retrieving daily stock prices.</p>

			<h4><span>Ruby/React on Rails:</span> Commission Marketplace website (in progress)</h4>
			<p>I am leading a small team to create a website for connecting content creators (artists, musicians, mixers, and animators) with potential commissioners, as well as organizing collaborations between content creators and organizers for larger projects. We are currently tackling features such as image similarity analysis and real-time user messaging.</p>

			<h4><span>React Native:</span> Crosswords of Destiny (in progress)</h4>
			<p>I am working with a partner on a mobile app for collaborative crossword solving. We decided to use React Native because it is cross-platform and has a wealth of user-made packages.</p>

			<h4><span>Python:</span> <a href="https://github.com/ztbartolome/Mad_Libs_Generator">Mad Libs Generator</a></h4>
			<p>I worked with Zeline Tricia Bartolome on a Python program that uses natural language processing to generate a MadLib from a passage of text. It processes the passage, then prompts the user to enter words of certain parts of speech and displays the resulting text. (I highly recommend trying it with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0u4M6vppCI">shia.txt</a>.)</p>

			<h4><span>Java</span></h4>
			<p>I was a teaching assistant for <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/registrar/schedule/course?acad_year=2020&crse_id=001751">COSI131a (Operating Systems)</a>, which uses Java to teach various OS concepts, as well as for <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/registrar/schedule/course?acad_year=2019&crse_id=012337">COSI12b (Advanced Programming Concepts)</a>, a course that gives students a solid foundation in Java. In this class, I was a primary author of a programming assignment based on finite state machines, which taught the basics of FSMs while reinforcing object-oriented programming concepts.</p>
			
			<h4><span>JavaScript:</span> <a href="https://eberleant.github.io/multiple-stopwatches/">Multiple Stopwatches</a></h4>
			<p>This tool allows the user to create multiple stopwatches and assign a keyboard shortcut to each one to quickly trigger them. It has many potential uses, but I use it to help myself and others with scripting songs (deciding who sings which lines) because I place a high priority on each singer getting approximately the same amount of time as every other singer. With this, I can quickly figure out how much time each singer has with only one playthrough of the song.</p>

			<h4><span>Bash:</span> <a href="https://github.com/eberleant/extract-rename-submissions">Script to help with grading</a></h4>
			<p>I wrote this small script to help me grade assignments as a teaching assistant. The school website allows me to download all student submissions at once, but the format involves lots of clicks and searches to find the students and submission files that I am supposed to grade. Running this script reorganizes the files so that they're much more efficient for me to find and grade.</p>
			
			<h4><span>SQL, STARLIMS, & JScript</span></h4>
			<p>For the past two summers, I have worked as an intern for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cq-consulting">CQ Consulting</a>, which is a contractor for the Arkansas Department of Health. In this time, I've had the opportunity to explore their extensive codebase of SQL, STARLIMS (a proprietary language), and JScript. In addition to bug-testing and documentation, I implemented pagination in the freezer log application, which keeps track of which medical samples are in which freezer.</p>
