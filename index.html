			<h3><span>A</span>BOUT ME</h3>
			<img src="./images/profile-pic.jpg" width="25%" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px">
			<p style="display: inline">Hello! My name is Evalyn Berleant. I am a junior at Brandeis University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I have experience in Java, JavaScript, React.js, Python, SQL, and bash. In Summer 2020, I interned at Galatea Associates, where I used the Java Spring Boot framework, React.js, and Lombok to write several API endpoints for various applications. I have worked as a TA for Advanced Programming Techniques and Operating Systems, and I interned for CQ Consulting as a contractor for the Arkansas Department of Health in Summers 2018 and 2019. I'm always excited to learn something new!</p>

			<h3><span>P</span>ROGRAMMING</h3>

			<h4><span>Ruby/React on Rails</span> (in progress)</h4>
			<p>I am leading a small team to create a website for connecting content creators (artists, musicians, mixers, and animators) with potential commissioners, as well as organizing collaborations between content creators and organizers for larger projects. We are currently tackling features such as image similarity analysis and real-time user messaging.</p>

			<h4><span>React Native</span> (in progress)</h4>
			<p>I am working with a partner on a mobile app for collaborative crossword solving. We decided to use React Native because it is cross-platform and has a wealth of user-made packages.</p>

			<h4><span>Python:</span> <a href="https://github.com/ztbartolome/Mad_Libs_Generator">Mad Libs Generator</a></h4>
			<p>I worked with Zeline Tricia Bartolome on a Python program that uses natural language processing to generate a MadLib from a passage of text. It processes the passage, then prompts the user to enter words of certain parts of speech and displays the resulting text. (I highly recommend trying it with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0u4M6vppCI">shia.txt</a>.)</p>

			<h4><span>Java</span></h4>
			<p>As an intern at Galatea Associates, I wrote several endopints using Java Spring Boot and Lombok. Through the internship, I learned about dependency injection, annotations and annotation-based configuration, and custom serialization/deserialization through Jackson.</p>
			<p>I was also a teaching assistant for <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/registrar/schedule/course?acad_year=2020&crse_id=001751">COSI131a (Operating Systems)</a>, which uses Java to teach various OS concepts, as well as for <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/registrar/schedule/course?acad_year=2019&crse_id=012337">COSI12b (Advanced Programming Concepts)</a>, a course that gives students a solid foundation in Java. In this class, I was a primary author of a programming assignment based on finite state machines, which taught the basics of FSMs while reinforcing object-oriented programming concepts.</p>
			
			<h4><span>JS:</span> <a href="https://eberleant.github.io/multiple-stopwatches/">Multiple Stopwatches</a></h4>
			<p>This tool allows the user to create multiple stopwatches and assign a keyboard shortcut to each one to quickly trigger them. It has many potential uses, but I use it to help myself and others with scripting songs (deciding who sings which lines) because I place a high priority on each singer getting approximately the same amount of time as every other singer. With this, I can quickly figure out how much time each singer has with only one playthrough of the song.</p>

			<h4><span>Bash:</span> <a href="https://github.com/eberleant/extract-rename-submissions">Script to help with grading</a></h4>
			<p>I wrote this small script to help me grade assignments as a teaching assistant. The school website allows me to download all student submissions at once, but the format involves lots of clicks and searches to find the students and submission files that I am supposed to grade. Running this script reorganizes the files so that they're much more efficient for me to find and grade.</p>
			
			<h4><span>SQL, STARLIMS, & JScript</span></h4>
			<p>For the past two summers, I have worked as an intern for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cq-consulting">CQ Consulting</a>, which is a contractor for the Arkansas Department of Health. In this time, I've had the opportunity to explore their extensive codebase of SQL, STARLIMS (a proprietary language), and JScript. In addition to bug-testing and documentation, I implemented pagination in the freezer log application, which keeps track of which medical samples are in which freezer.</p>

			<h4><span>JS:</span> <a href="https://eberleant.github.io/calculator/">Calculator</a></h4>
			<p>To learn JavaScript, I used a website called <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. As the final project in the JavaScript Basics section, I created a JavaScript calculator. (I am still working through TOP's courses, learning back-end in Ruby right now - although it's slow going during the school year.)</p>
